            <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> Account data required to provide services</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Security monitoring, fraud prevention, moderation, rule enforcement, maintaining moderation history, detecting repeat or escalating violations, preventing ban evasion, abuse investigation, and handling appeals. Retention of historical moderation records is necessary to ensure fair, consistent, and effective enforcement across our community.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gameplay and chat logs:</strong> Retained for up to 30 days to support moderation review and incident investigation. Logs are automatically deleted after this period unless they are part of an active moderation case.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderation records:</strong> Records such as bans, warnings, and administrative notes are retained as long as they are necessary for moderation, rule enforcement, abuse prevention, and maintaining the integrity of the service. This includes historical records of previous bans and warnings, which help moderators understand patterns of behavior and ensure consistent enforcement.</li>
                <li><strong>Permanent bans:</strong> Treated as ongoing enforcement actions and retained for as long as necessary for moderation and enforcement purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware identifiers (HWIDs) and connection identifiers (such as IP addresses):</strong> Retained where necessary to enforce bans, prevent ban evasion, and protect the integrity of the service. These identifiers are used solely for enforcement and security purposes, and are not used for marketing, profiling, or advertising.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not retain data longer than necessary for its stated purpose.</p>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Security Incidents</h2>
            <p>We will notify affected EU users within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach that risks their rights and freedoms. Affected users will be notified directly where feasible. Public announcement channels, such as our <a href="https://discord.com/servers/goob-station-1202734573247795300">Discord server</a>, may be used as a supplementary notification method.</p>
